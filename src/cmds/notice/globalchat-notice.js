‚Ä¢ The Global Chat was built to be fun, but it needs your cooperation to help keeping it fun and cozy for everyone.

‚Ä¢ Since it can connect you to all sorts of different people, try not to say anything insulting, discriminatory, or sexual. You never know who will be on the other side.

‚Ä¢ Global Chat isn‚Äôt for advertising, nor for recruiting. People don‚Äôt like telemarketers and marketing on real phone calls, and nor do the people using it to communicate with each other!

‚Ä¢ Everyone has feelings, so don‚Äôt bully other users who uses this chat out of spite. Doing so can affect, or even ruins their life.

‚Ä¢ Nobody wants to be friends with a person just to get an ad from them, So make sure they‚Äôre OK with being friends first if you make new friends within the chat.

‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt even try to be anyone you aren‚Äôt. Impersonation can be misleading and confusing. Staffs responsible for the bot do use the chat, and they will have this badge appended to them: üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Trying to argue with us for stupid reasons and you will regret it. Impersonating us won't work.

‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs always the chance of users using the phones for malicious purposes. Report an excerpt of the conversation in Global Chat by going to our server, and we will check the that excerpt to see suspicious activities.

‚Ä¢ Lastly, use your common sense. Decide whether you should do something that may or may not lead you to a punishment. It will help you a lot.
